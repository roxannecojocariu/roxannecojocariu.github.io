      <h3>Positive Me!</h3><p>
      Positive Me! is an application that outputs positive quotes to lift a user's mood! A user will be presented with three different mood categories to choose from. Upon choosing a category, a quote (based on that mood) will be output with two additional options to favorite the quote or generate a new one. I truly believe in the power of positive thinking and positive affirmations. Through this app, a user is able to get both with each generated quote to make for a better balanced and more cheerful life!

      This app integrates an external API, They Said So, into a Ruby on Rails framework. The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database, and uses Foundation front-end with custom CSS.<p>

      <h3>Park Reviews</h3><p>
      Park Reviews is an application that allows users to post and review national parks through the use of a PostgresSQL database. Through React and the Ruby on Rails framework, this application was collaboratively built by a fantastic team at Launch Academy! The application utilizes CarrierWave through AWS for user profile photo uploads, and is deployed through Heroku.

      Team Members: Roxanne Cojocariu, Rachel Cooke, Matthew Clarke, and Andrew McLellan

      The application was built for the purposes of practicing pair programming, learning Heroku, and to incorporate a better understanding of Launch's curriculum.<p>
